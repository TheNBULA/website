## Mission Statement
The Non-Binary Union of Los Angeles (NBULA) builds social spaces for people who identify underneath the non-binary umbrella, beyond the binaries of sex and/or gender, and folks who are questioning. In NBULA communities we seek to celebrate, connect, explore, and express our identities together. We are building a present and future world where we can belong authentically, wherever we are.

NBULA was established on Tongva Land (so-called Los Angeles) in 2019.

## Pronunciation

We pronounce "NBULA" like "nebula".
