## Mission Statement

The Non-Binary Union of Los Angeles (NBULA) builds social spaces for people who identify underneath the non-binary umbrella, beyond the binaries of sex and/or gender, and folks who are questioning. In NBULA communities we seek to celebrate, connect, explore, and express our identities together.

Ableism, capitalism, and racism have harmed our communities. We oppose their ideologies and are committed to unlearning what we have already internalized. We are building a present and future world where we can belong authentically, wherever we are.

NBULA was established on Tongva Land (so-called Los Angeles) in 2019.


## Pronunciation

We pronounce "NBULA" like "nebula".
