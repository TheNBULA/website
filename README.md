## GitHub Pages

You can edit the pages directly in the browser here on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing.

For an example of rendered Markdown, see:
1. GitHub: [`formatting_examples.md`](formatting_examples.md)
2. Website: [nbula.org/formatting_examples](https://nbula.org/formatting_examples)

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have
selected in your [repository
settings](https://github.com/TheNBULA/website/settings/pages). The name of this
theme is saved in the Jekyll [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) configuration file:
- [pages-themes/cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman): *Cayman is a
  Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages*
